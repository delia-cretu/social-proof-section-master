## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was proud I figured out how to use CSS Flexbox inside individual elements that are part of a CSS Grid.

### Continued development

I used a lot of classes and IDs in this HTML document and would like to figure out a way to reduce them in order to make my code more efficient and easier to follow.
